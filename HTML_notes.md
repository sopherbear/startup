## Basics of HTML

To comment:
```
<!-- This is an HTML comment -->
```

### Starting out a document:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>About</title>
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" />
  </head>
```
This part takes care of some basic formatting, including:
* Language
* Characters that can be used
* What words appear on the tab
* What image appears on the tab

### The Body
Place links for navigating around the webpage under "nav"
