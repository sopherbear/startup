# Family Recipebook Application

## Specification Deliverable
This section contains the details required in the startup specification assignment. 

### Elevator pitch

Nothing seems to bring family together quite like Grammy's apple pie, Dad's grilled pork chops, or Great great Aunt Tilly's closely-guarded rhubarb crumble. By sharing and passing down these recipes, we can create rich family traditions and keep the memory of our loved ones close by, even if they have passed or live far away. This application will format, categorize, and alphabetize recipes that users enter into an online, sharable recipebook that the whole extended family can have access to, without the risk of the recipes getting lost or damaged over years of use.
